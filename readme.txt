== Description ==

**Remove Unwanted Block Suggestions of Block Directory From Editor** is a simple lightweight plug & play plugin. It will help you to Remove Block Directory From your Block Editor. üòÅ

**Note:** it's a plug-and-play plugin with no setting page. 

If you search for a block, if this block is not on your site, WordPress shows the possible suggestion on that category of the blocks. Also, it offers similar blocks as suggestions. But it's sometimes annoying to you and confusing as well. It will confuse your clients as well. I believe you don't want to mess up with your site's setup. 

But there's no clear way of disabling the Block Directory for the nontechies. We expect sites to want to control whether the Block Directory is available and disable it. We would like to disable it on some of our sites. 

There is a long discussion on Github. So many developers came up with possible solutions. The WordPress core solution is easy for developers. Here is the solution: https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/filters/editor-filters/#block-directory

But for us who are non-techies, afraid of adding codes to the core files. So we need a simple solution. So I came up with this simple plugin. It has no settings. Just install, and active the loading block suggestion will be removed. 

I'm thankful to Tom J Nowell (https://github.com/tomjn). I took his code snippet and made this plugin for helping the non-techies. 
His code is available here: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23961.
